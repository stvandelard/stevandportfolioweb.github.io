            A UEFA Champions League Simulation CLI-based Video Game. UEFA
            Champions League is an annual club association football competition
            organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). It
            is contested by top-division European clubs, deciding the
            competition winners through a round robin group stage to qualify for
            a double-legged knockout format, and a single leg final. There are
            32 teams are drawn into eight groups of four teams and play each
            other in a double round-robin system. The eight group winners and
            eight runners-up proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with
            the final match.<br />
            In this game, there are 64 teams from across Europe the players can
            select. Once the players selected 1 team, they can change the
            manager name or not and then they can start the tournament
            simulation. First, the game will select 32 (including the team that
            the player selected before) teams out of 64 teams randomly, and put
            it on 8 groups. Each group had 4 teams on it, this step is called
            "drawing". After the group stage drawing, players will be directed
            to the "main page", which consists of 5 features: 1.Advance, 2.Data,
            3.Stats, 4.Restart Game, 5.Exit Game. If the player choose Data they
            will able to see all the information of 32 participating teams
            including club name, country, home stadium, manager, the team's UCL
            titles and which group they are drawn. If the player choose Stats,
            they will able to see the player's team stats, other teams stats and
            match stats. If the player choose Advance, the game will simulate
            the group stage matchday 1. The game will randomly simulate the
            match score and automatically updated the group stage standings.
            After 6 matchday group stage matches, if the players ranked 1st or
            2nd in the group stage standing, the player will advance to the
            double-legged knockout stage, otherwise the player will be
            eliminated and the game is over. <br />
            In the knockout stage, each stage will be randomly drawn to
            determine which team the player will face. The knockout stage format
            will be played in 2 legs, there are several conditions for each team
            to win and advance: by aggregate, away goals, or penalties. This
            format is applied for Round of 16, Quarter Finals and Semifinal. The
            final itself will be played in a single match to determine the UEFA
            Champions League Winner. <br />
            This game was developed using pascal programming language with 3006
            lines of source code. Sublime Text was the main IDE used for
            developing this video game.
